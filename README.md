### 1. Introduction

__`Data drives the world.`__ Nowadays, most of the data (_structured_ or _unstructured_) can be analysed as a graph. Today, many practical computing problems concern large graphs. Standard examples include the Web graph and various social networks. The scale of these graphs (_in some cases billions of vertices, trillions of edges_) poses challenges to their efficient processing.

### 2. About the course

During this course, we will be introduced to techniques and tools for _analyzing_ and _visualizing_ data. It emphasizes how to combine computation and visualization to perform effective analysis. The course consists of two parts: a series of lectures on analytics and a series of lectures on visualization. Both parts will include hands-on tutorials during which you will work on analysis problems and start to build your own tools.

### 3. Labs

The main aim of this repository is to keep track of the work we have done in __Visual Analysis (VA)__ labs. 

#

<a id="lab-1" />

#### 3.1. Lab 01 - Web Scrapping via Beautiful Soup

[Web Scrapping via Beautiful Soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python package for the scraping data from the internet.

Please checkout lab's details [here](https://github.com/mohammadzainabbas/VA-Lab/tree/main/src/lab1) 

#

<a id="setup" />

### 4. Setup

If you want to follow along with the lab exercises, make sure to clone and `cd` to the relevant lab's directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohammadzainabbas/VA-Lab.git
cd VA-Lab/src/<lab-of-your-choice>
```

> For e.g: if you want to practice lab # 1, then you should do `cd VA-Lab/src/lab1`.

<a id="create-new-env" />

#### 4.1. Create new enviornment

Before starting, you may have to create new enviornment for the lab. Kindly, checkout the [documentation](https://github.com/mohammadzainabbas/VA-Lab/blob/main/docs/SETUP_ENV.md) for creating an new environment.

#

Once, you have activated your new enviornment, we may have to install all the dependencies for a given lab (kindly check if `requirements.txt` file exists for a given lab before running the below command):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4.2. Setup `pre-commit` hooks

In order to setup `pre-commit` hooks, please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/mohammadzainabbas/VA-Lab/blob/main/docs/SETUP_PRE-COMMIT_HOOKS.md).
