### 1. Introduction

__`Data drives the world.`__ Nowadays, most of the data (_structured_ or _unstructured_) can be analysed easily via different techniques. In order to analyse your data, first you have to collect the data. We looked at the data collection part in the [last lab](https://github.com/mohammadzainabbas/VA-Lab/tree/main/src/lab1). 

Once, we have our data, its important to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) first. Visualisation is the key part of EDA.

In this lab, we will use Vega-Altair package to see how we can visualise our data and interact with it as well to gain better understanding of our data.

#### 1.1. Vega-Altair

[Vega-Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python, based on Vega and Vega-Lite.

### 2. Data

For the purpose of this lab, we will use one of the built-in datasets i.e: `cars` from `vega_datasets` package. To follow along, simply import it from `vega_datasets` package.

```python
# Load car data from example datasets
from vega_datasets import data
cars = data.cars()
```

### 3. Setup

If you want to follow along, make sure to clone and `cd` to this lab's directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohammadzainabbas/VA-Lab.git
cd VA-Lab/src/lab1
```

#### 3.1. Create new enviornment

Before starting, you may have to create new enviornment for the lab. Kindly, checkout the [documentation](https://github.com/mohammadzainabbas/VA-Lab/blob/main/docs/SETUP_ENV.md) for creating an new environment.

#

Once, you have activated your new enviornment, we will install all the dependencies of this project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3.2. Setup `pre-commit` hooks

In order to setup `pre-commit` hooks, please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/mohammadzainabbas/VA-Lab/blob/main/docs/SETUP_PRE-COMMIT_HOOKS.md).
